# HTML Portfolio

### Introduction

What we'll be doing here is converting our markdown portfolio to HTML. We should be able to take advantage of the extra features of HTML to make it extra awesome!

### Setup

Go into your original REPL and work with the HTML file that's already in there (`index.html`). Your Markdown file will be your reference for content.

If you didn't make a Markdown portfolio, then you can start at the beginning, either doing Markdown first or skipping it altogether. Here are [the guidelines for the original project](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/markdown-portfolio).

### Basic Steps

1. Your first goal is to make the HTML page look _just_ like your Markdown page. Please do not use any auto-conversion tools, but you're welcome to copy-paste from your Markdown file and convert it line by line. Use REPL to preview things as you go--the process for that outside of Markdown is to hit the Run button at the top (which you can also do by hitting Command-Enter on your keyboard on the Mac, or Control-Enter on Windows or Linux).
2. Once you've got your portfolio looking good in HTML format, let's expand it! You'll have to do some research for some of these if you don't have any HTML experience, but either way, add:
   - A text input box and a button. They don't have to do anything!
   - A link to a second HTML page. Or a third, or a fourth, or even more, if it serves your content. You'll have to make a new HTML file in your REPL.
   - A link to an external site that opens that site _in a new window or tab_.
   - An image with a set width attribute, so that it has a different size than the original file.
   - A centered heading. Probably best if it's the first-level one.
3. If you're feeling brave, add some CSS for styling and layout. You'll have to do some research if you're not yet familiar with CSS syntax, but we'll be learning it soon.
4. Expand the content further as you see fit!

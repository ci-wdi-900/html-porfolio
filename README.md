# HTML Portfolio

### Introduction

What we'll be doing here is converting our markdown portfolio to HTML. We should be able to take advantage of the extra features of HTML to make it extra awesome!


### Setup

Create a new HTML file on REPL and get started!


### Basic Steps

1. Now your goal is to make the HTML page look _just_ like your markdown page. Please do not use any auto-conversion tools, but you're welcome to copy-paste from your Markdown file and convert it line by line. Use REPL to preview things as you go!
2. Once you've got it looking good, let's expand it! You'll have to do some research for some of these if you don't have any HTML experience, but either way, add:
    * A text input box and a button. They don't have to do anything!
    * A link to a second HTML page. Or a third, or a fourth, or even more, if it serves your content.
    * A link to an external site that opens that site _in a new window or tab_.
    * An image with a set width attribute, so that it has a different size than before.
3. Expand further as you see fit!

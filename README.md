# HTML Portfolio

### Introduction

What we'll be doing here is converting our markdown portfolio to html. We should be able to take advantage of the extra features of html to make it extra awesome!


### Setup

1. You'll be making a NEW repo with this one. Create it on GitHub with a README initialized, then clone it down.
2. Once you navigate to the repo, you'll want to make an html file. The standard is to start with a file called `index.html`. We can definitely expand from there, but that is almost always your "home page". Now that you've created a file, this is a good time to `push` up for the first time with the classic "Initial commit." message!


### Basic Steps

1. Now your goal is to make the html page look _just_ like your markdown page. Please do not use any auto-conversion tools, but you're welcome to copy-paste from your Markdown file and convert it line by line. Use Live Server to preview things as you go!
2. Once you've got it looking good, let's expand it! You'll have to do some research for some of these if you don't have any html experience, but either way, add:
    * A text input box and a button. They don't have to do anything!
    * A link to a second html page. Or a third, or a fourth, or even more, if it serves your content.
    * A link to an external site that opens that site _in a new window or tab_.
    * An image with a set width attribute, so that it has a different size than before.

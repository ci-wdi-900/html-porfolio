# HTML Portfolio

### Introduction

What we'll be doing here is converting our markdown portfolio to HTML. We should be able to take advantage of the extra features of HTML to make it extra awesome!


### Setup

Go into your original REPL and work with the HTML. Your Markdown file will be your reference for content.

If you didn't make a Markdown portfolio, then you can start at the beginning, either doing Markdown first or skipping it altogether. Here are [the guidelines for the original project](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/markdown-portfolio).


### Basic Steps

1. Now your goal is to make the HTML page look _just_ like your markdown page. Please do not use any auto-conversion tools, but you're welcome to copy-paste from your Markdown file and convert it line by line. Use REPL to preview things as you go! (Just click "Run"!)
2. Once you've got it looking good, let's expand it! You'll have to do some research for some of these if you don't have any HTML experience, but either way, add:
    * A text input box and a button. They don't have to do anything!
    * A link to a second HTML page. Or a third, or a fourth, or even more, if it serves your content.
    * A link to an external site that opens that site _in a new window or tab_.
    * An image with a set width attribute, so that it has a different size than before.
3. Expand further as you see fit!
